## P1 — Feature Requests

### Move `journal` to top-level command

`journal` is currently nested under `pftui agent journal`. It should be top-level: `pftui journal`.

Journal is the shared knowledge layer (predictions, convictions, notes, scenarios, entries).
It is used by both humans and agents. Nesting it under `agent` implies it's agent-only,
but a human tracks predictions and convictions too. It belongs alongside `portfolio`,
`analytics`, `data`, `agent`, and `system` as a peer.

```
# Current (wrong):
pftui agent journal prediction add ...
pftui agent journal conviction set ...

# Target:
pftui journal prediction add ...
pftui journal conviction set ...
```

Move `journal` out of `agent` to top-level. Keep `agent message` under `agent`.
Update `docs/CLI-TREE.md` and `docs/CLI-MIGRATION.md`.

Source: `src/cli.rs` (move Journal enum from Agent to top-level Commands), `src/main.rs`.

### [Feedback] Weekend-Aware Movers Command

`pftui analytics movers` shows 0 movers on weekends because it compares to Friday close. Should compare Friday close to weekend crypto/futures prices (Hyperliquid, Binance perpetuals) so agents running Saturday/Sunday routines still see meaningful movements.

Source: evening-analysis feedback (Mar 15). Files: `src/commands/movers.rs`.

### [Feedback] `analytics scenario list --json`

`pftui analytics scenario list` should support `--json` output for programmatic consumption. Currently agents must cross-reference scenario names manually. Most other analytics commands already support `--json`.

Source: evening-analysis feedback (Mar 15). Files: `src/commands/scenario.rs`, `src/cli.rs`.

### ~~F42: CLI Domain Consolidation~~ ✅ Complete (shipped v0.10.0)

All 10 subtasks completed. Five-domain hierarchy finalized: `agent`, `analytics`, `data`, `portfolio`, `system`.

## P2 — Nice to Have

## P3 — Long Term

### ~~F40: CLI Hierarchy Restructure~~ ✅ Complete (shipped v0.10.0)

Full namespace restructure shipped. All legacy aliases removed. All agent routines and docs updated to canonical v0.10.0 paths.

### F41: Interactive Shell (`pftui shell`)

> A human-friendly interactive CLI session with autocompletion and command discovery.
> Not a TUI with panels. A shell. Think Cisco IOS, Redis CLI, or MySQL monitor.

```
$ pftui shell
pftui> analytics macro
  compare      Head-to-head power comparison between two countries
  cycles       Big Cycle and Fourth Turning stage tracking
  history      Historical power metrics by decade
  log          Weekly structural observations
  metrics      Dalio 8 determinants for a country
  outcomes     Structural outcome probabilities
  parallels    Historical parallel tracker
  regime       Market regime classification

pftui> analytics macro cycles history --country US --decade 1940
[output]

pftui> journal prediction scorecard --date yesterday
[output]
```

Features:
- Tab completion at every level of the command tree
- `?` or partial command shows available subcommands with descriptions (IOS-style)
- Command history (readline/rustyline with persistent history file)
- Context-aware: after typing `journal`, only journal subcommands complete
- Colored output, same as CLI
- `exit` or Ctrl-D to quit
- Optional: `enable` mode for destructive operations (add, remove, update)

Implementation: `rustyline` crate for readline. Build completer from the clap
command tree (clap already knows the full hierarchy). Each command's `about` text
becomes the description shown in the library view.

Low priority. The deep CLI hierarchy must ship first (F40) since this shell
is built on top of it. The better the tree, the better the shell.

Source: new `src/commands/shell.rs`, `src/cli.rs` (add shell subcommand).

### F36: Investor Perspectives Panel

Multi-lens macro analysis via sub-agents. 15 named legends + 10 archetypes + custom.
Full spec in git history (commit `5e34607`). Depends on F31 `--json` completeness
and OpenClaw sub-agent spawning.

### F39.7 Data Population (Sentinel, post-dev-cron)

> After dev cron ships F39.7 CLI + schema, spawn a research sub-agent to populate
> the historical database. The sub-agent should:
>
> 1. Research each determinant for each power at each decade using web_search
> 2. Score on Dalio's 1-10 scale with brief justification and source
> 3. Populate via `pftui analytics macro history add` CLI commands
> 4. Cross-reference Dalio's own charts from "Principles for Dealing with
>    the Changing World Order" as a baseline, then refine with primary sources
>
> Powers and spans:
> - US: 1900-2020 (13 decades)
> - China: 1900-2020 (13 decades)
> - Russia/USSR: 1900-2020 (13 decades, note regime transitions)
> - UK/British Empire: 1900-2020 (13 decades, the decline narrative)
> - Japan: 1900-2020 (13 decades, rise and plateau)
> - EU: 1950-2020 (8 decades, post-ECSC)
> - India: 1950-2020 (8 decades, post-independence)
> - Saudi: 1940-2020 (9 decades, post-oil discovery)
>
> Estimated: ~700 rows. Each needs a score, notes, and source.
> Break into multiple sub-agent runs by country if needed.

## Feedback Summary

**Latest Scores Per Tester (most recent review):**

| Tester | Latest Score | Date | Trend |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| Morning Market Research | 88% | Mar 7 | ↑ (recovered from 15% DB crash; last working review strong) |
| Evening Eventuality Planner | 82% | Mar 8 | ↑ (recovered from hang; stable 75-88% when working) |
| Sentinel Main (TUI) | 72% | Mar 10 | → (stable 72-88% range; Day$ P&L shipped, needs next review) |
| Market Close | 92% | Mar 6 | ↑ (peaked when data pipeline stable; movers fix shipped) |
| UX Analyst | 75% | Mar 8 | → (stable 68-78% range) |
| Integration Optimiser | 70% | Mar 11 | — (single review) |
| Medium-Timeframe Analyst | 88% | Mar 15 | ↑ (strong analytical workflow, 85% of routine handled by pftui) |
| Low-Timeframe Analyst | 80% | Mar 14 | → (solid analytics platform) |
| Morning Brief Agent | 75% | Mar 14 | — (first scored review) |
| Evening Analysis | 75% | Mar 15 | → (weekend-aware movers gap noted) |

**Score Trend Notes:**
- Agent scores have broadly stabilized in the 72-88% range since the DB crash/hang bugs were fixed (Mar 9).
- Medium-timeframe analyst hit 88% — highest new-tester score — reflecting mature analytics engine.
- Sentinel TUI plateau (72-88%) should break upward: Day$ P&L was shipped (CHANGELOG Mar 14 `ba86400`).
- Most recent feedback is from the agent pipeline testers (low/medium/evening/morning), not the original four (Morning Research, Evening Planner, Sentinel, Market Close). The original testers haven't reviewed since the Mar 14 batch of fixes.
- F42 CLI domain consolidation shipped and all agent routines updated to v0.10.0 paths.

**Top 3 Priorities Based on Feedback:**

1. **Move `journal` to top-level command** — Currently under `agent journal`. Journal is the shared knowledge layer used by humans and agents alike. In-progress P1.
2. **Weekend-aware movers** — Agents running Saturday/Sunday routines see 0 movers. Need crypto/futures comparison for weekend context. New P1 from Mar 15.
3. **`analytics scenario list --json`** — Most analytics commands support `--json` but scenarios list doesn't. Breaks agent consistency expectations. New P1 from Mar 15.

- ✅ Data source conflict detection (shipped Mar 14)
- ✅ `predict score` positional args (shipped Mar 14)
