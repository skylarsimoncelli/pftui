### Current Scores (latest per tester)

| Tester | Usefulness | Overall | Trend |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Market Research | 88% | 82% | ↑ (40→72→78→78→74→88) |
| Eventuality Planner | 82% | 80% | ↑ (38→85→92→85→80→82) |

| Market Close | 92% | 88% | ↑ (68→80→72→88) |
| UX Analyst | — | 75% | → (78→68→72→73→75) |

### Score Trends

- **Market Research:** Strong upswing to 88/82 — best scores yet. Macro technicals (RSI/MACD/SMA) landed on Mar 7 and this tester noticed. Remaining gap: oil technicals in brief (now in macro), and prediction markets showing sports instead of geopolitical. Python script dependency nearly eliminated.
- **Eventuality Planner:** Stable at 82/80. `eod` command and macro dashboard are star features. Pain points: sector command returning only 1 ETF, prediction markets filtering for geopolitics, and missing ag commodity tracking. Wants CME FedWatch.
- **Sentinel (Portfolio Analyst):** Best overall score yet (85/88). TUI visual quality consistently praised. Ratio charts context header (added Mar 7) well received.
- **Market Close:** Strongest absolute scores (92/88) — no new review since Mar 6. `brief + movers + macro` pipeline covers most of the routine. Python script nearly eliminated.
- **UX Analyst:** Slight uptick to 75. Focus shifted from CLI consistency (mostly fixed) to feature discoverability (`pftui config` invisible) and `status --json` gap. Data pipeline reliability improving but predictions/COT still intermittent.

### Top 3 Priorities (Feedback-Driven)

1. ✅ **Brave Search API integration** — COMPLETE (Mar 7, 2026). Config, client, news, economic data, research command all shipped.
2. **Config discoverability** — Config command exists but isn't surfaced in help or README.
3. **PostgreSQL backend support** — The only remaining P1 item.
