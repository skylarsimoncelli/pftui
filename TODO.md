## P0 — Bugs & Fixes

> Broken existing functionality. Fix before shipping.

### CLI Consistency (batch: ~1hr)
- [ ] **Add `--json` to `alerts list`** — Alerts already has `--json` for `check` but not `list`. Files: `cli.rs`, `commands/alerts.rs`
- [ ] **Add `--json` to `journal list/search`** — Journal has `--json` but only for some subcommands. Audit all. Files: `cli.rs`, `commands/journal.rs`
- [ ] **Audit all CLI commands for `--json` consistency** — Every command that outputs data should support `--json`. Test each one. Files: `cli.rs`, `commands/*.rs`

### UX Cohesion
- [ ] **Sidebar ratio charts need context** — DXY/Gold, DXY/SPX, DXY/BTC charts are beautiful but new users don't understand why they're shown. Add "Key Macro Ratios" header with brief explanation. Files: `tui/views/asset_overview.rs` or equivalent sidebar widget
- [ ] **Regime suggestions should be portfolio-aware** — Economy tab regime advice is generic ("consider defensive positioning"). Should reference actual holdings ("your 25% gold allocation is well-positioned for..."). Files: `tui/views/economy.rs`

### Data Pipeline Reliability
- [ ] [Feedback] **Fix predictions data source** — Polymarket parser returns only sports/NHL markets, no geopolitical or financial predictions. Category filtering doesn't surface macro-relevant markets. Testers need ceasefire odds, rate cut probabilities, recession odds. Files: `data/predictions.rs`, `commands/predictions.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **Fix ETF flows command** — `pftui etf-flows` fails with exit code 1 or returns empty. BTC ETF flow data (IBIT, FBTC, ARKB daily flows) is critical for crypto analysis. CoinGlass JS rendering blocks scraping. Files: `data/onchain.rs`, `commands/etf_flows.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **Fix COT data availability** — COT data shows "unavailable" for some testers despite field name fix. Verify CFTC API returns data consistently. Files: `data/cot.rs`, `db/cot_cache.rs`

## P1 — Feature Requests

> User-requested features and high-value improvements.

### Data & Display
- [ ] **Candlestick chart variant** — OHLC data layer is done. Implement braille/block candlestick renderer using new open/high/low fields. New variant `ChartVariant::Candlestick`, keybinding, renderer. Files: `app.rs`, `widgets/price_chart.rs`
- [ ] **SMA overlay on charts** — Configurable `chart_sma = [20, 50, 200]`. Faint braille lines. Files: `widgets/price_chart.rs`, `config.rs`
- [ ] **Volume sub-chart** — 3-row braille bars below price. Toggle with `V`. Files: `widgets/price_chart.rs`
- [ ] **After-hours / pre-market prices** — Yahoo provides extended hours data. Show in watchlist and brief. Files: `price/yahoo.rs`, `commands/brief.rs`
- [ ] **Brent crude + WTI spread in macro** — Key metric for geopolitical crises. Files: `commands/macro_cmd.rs`, `views/economy.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **Technicals on macro dashboard** — Add RSI(14), MACD, SMA(50) for macro instruments (DXY, VIX, oil, 10Y, copper). This is the #1 remaining reason testers use the external Python script. Files: `commands/macro_cmd.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **Technicals on watchlist** — Add RSI/SMA50 columns for all watchlist symbols, not just held positions. Eliminates Python script dependency entirely. Files: `commands/watchlist_cli.rs`, `tui/views/watchlist.rs`

### CLI Enhancements
- [ ] **`pftui eod` command** — Market close command combining brief + movers + macro + sentiment. Files: new `commands/eod.rs`
- [ ] **`pftui sector` command** — Sector ETF performance (XLE, XLF, IGV, etc.). Files: new `commands/sector.rs`
- [ ] **`pftui calendar` CLI** — `pftui calendar` (next 7 days), `--days 30`, `--impact high`, `--json`. Files: new `commands/calendar.rs`
- [ ] **Alerts in `brief` output** — Show triggered/near-threshold alerts. Files: `commands/brief.rs`
- [ ] **"What Changed Today" in `brief`** — Top movers, threshold crossings, triggered alerts. Files: `commands/brief.rs`

- [ ] **Portfolio stress testing CLI** — `pftui stress-test` with named scenarios. Builds on F4.2 engine. Files: new `commands/stress_test.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **`pftui status --data` command** — Per-source data health: prices (✓ fresh 3h ago), predictions (✗ parse error), COT (✗ unavailable), news (✓ 92 articles), BLS (✗ parse error). Makes data availability transparent. Files: new `commands/status_data.rs` or extend `commands/status.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **Prediction category filtering** — `pftui predictions --category geopolitics` should filter out sports/entertainment. Add query search for specific topics (e.g., "ceasefire", "Fed rate"). Files: `commands/predictions.rs`, `data/predictions.rs`

### Analytics
- [ ] **Correlation grid in Markets tab** — Color-coded matrix (green/red). Toggle 7d/30d/90d. Files: `views/markets.rs`, new `views/correlation_grid.rs`
- [ ] **Correlations in `brief`** — Top pairs + active breaks. Files: `commands/brief.rs`
- [ ] [Feedback] **`pftui correlations` CLI** — Rolling correlations between held assets (gold-DXY, BTC-SPX, silver-gold). Foundation module already exists in `indicators/correlation.rs`. Files: new `commands/correlations.rs`
- [ ] **Position annotations & thesis tracking** — SQLite table with thesis, invalidation criteria, review dates, targets. CLI: `pftui annotate GC=F --thesis "..."`. Show in detail popup. Files: new `db/annotations.rs`, new `commands/annotate.rs`, `views/asset_detail_popup.rs`
- [ ] **Review date alerts** — Overdue review dates show ⏰ in Positions tab. Auto-creates alert. Files: `alerts/engine.rs`, `views/positions.rs`
- [ ] **Asset groups** — `pftui group create "hard-assets" --symbols GC=F,SI=F,BTC`. Combined allocation + performance. Filter positions by group. Files: new `db/groups.rs`, new `commands/group.rs`

## Feedback Summary

> Updated: 2026-03-07

### Current Scores (latest per tester)

| Tester | Usefulness | Overall | Trend |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Market Research | 78% | 74% | ↑ (40→72→78→78→74) |
| Eventuality Planner | 82% | 80% | ↑ (38→85→92→85→80) |
| Sentinel (Portfolio Analyst) | 78% | 82% | → (78→82→82→78→82) |
| Market Close | 92% | 88% | ↑ (68→80→72→88) |
| UX Analyst | — | 73% | → (78→68→72→73) |

### Score Trends

- **Market Research:** Strong recovery from 40→74. Plateaued around 74-78. Main blocker: still needs Python script for RSI/MACD/SMA on macro assets.
- **Eventuality Planner:** Best improvement arc (38→92 peak). Slight dip to 80 on Mar 7. Macro dashboard is the star feature. ETF flows failure and prediction markets filtering are pain points.
- **Sentinel (Portfolio Analyst):** Stable at 78-82. Consistently asks for day P&L dollar column, sector grouping, and enhanced watchlist signals. TUI visual quality highly praised.
- **Market Close:** Strongest recent score (92/88). `brief + movers + macro` pipeline now covers most of the routine. Python script nearly eliminated. Wants correlations and sector heatmap.
- **UX Analyst:** Lowest scorer at 73. Focus is on CLI consistency (--json gaps), data pipeline reliability (predictions/COT/BLS parse errors), and feature discoverability. Watchlist --json was fixed (Mar 7).

### Top 3 Priorities (Feedback-Driven)

1. **Fix data pipeline stubs** (P0) — Predictions returns sports only, ETF flows fails, COT/BLS intermittent. Half the advertised features show "no data". This is the UX Analyst's core complaint and the biggest trust issue.
2. **Add technicals to macro + watchlist** (P1) — RSI/MACD/SMA on macro dashboard and watchlist. This single feature eliminates the Python script dependency that 3/4 testers still rely on. Highest-leverage feature for score improvement.
3. **`pftui status --data` command** (P1) — Per-source data health transparency. Makes it clear which integrations work vs which are broken, instead of silent failures.
