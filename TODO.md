## P1 — Feature Requests

> User-requested features and high-value improvements.

### Data & Display

- [ ] [Feedback] **Prediction category filtering** — `pftui predictions --category geopolitics` should filter out sports/entertainment. Add query search for specific topics (e.g., "ceasefire", "Fed rate"). Files: `commands/predictions.rs`, `data/predictions.rs`

### Analytics

## Feedback Summary

> Updated: 2026-03-07

### Current Scores (latest per tester)

| Tester | Usefulness | Overall | Trend |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Market Research | 78% | 74% | ↑ (40→72→78→78→74) |
| Eventuality Planner | 82% | 80% | ↑ (38→85→92→85→80) |
| Sentinel (Portfolio Analyst) | 78% | 82% | → (78→82→82→78→82) |
| Market Close | 92% | 88% | ↑ (68→80→72→88) |
| UX Analyst | — | 73% | → (78→68→72→73) |

### Score Trends

- **Market Research:** Strong recovery from 40→74. Plateaued around 74-78. Main blocker: still needs Python script for RSI/MACD/SMA on macro assets.
- **Eventuality Planner:** Best improvement arc (38→92 peak). Slight dip to 80 on Mar 7. Macro dashboard is the star feature. ETF flows failure and prediction markets filtering are pain points.
- **Sentinel (Portfolio Analyst):** Stable at 78-82. Consistently asks for day P&L dollar column, sector grouping, and enhanced watchlist signals. TUI visual quality highly praised.
- **Market Close:** Strongest recent score (92/88). `brief + movers + macro` pipeline now covers most of the routine. Python script nearly eliminated. Wants correlations and sector heatmap.
- **UX Analyst:** Lowest scorer at 73. Focus is on CLI consistency (--json gaps), data pipeline reliability (predictions/COT/BLS parse errors), and feature discoverability. Watchlist --json was fixed (Mar 7).

### Top 3 Priorities (Feedback-Driven)

1. **Fix data pipeline stubs** (P0) — Predictions returns sports only, ETF flows fails, COT/BLS intermittent. Half the advertised features show "no data". This is the UX Analyst's core complaint and the biggest trust issue.
2. **Add technicals to macro + watchlist** (P1) — RSI/MACD/SMA on macro dashboard and watchlist. This single feature eliminates the Python script dependency that 3/4 testers still rely on. Highest-leverage feature for score improvement.
3. **`pftui status --data` command** (P1) — Per-source data health transparency. Makes it clear which integrations work vs which are broken, instead of silent failures.
