## P1 — Header & Status Bar Enhancements


## P1 — Regime Intelligence (Sentinel Proposed)



## P1 — CLI Enhancements (Feedback)

- [ ] **[Feedback] Native multi-currency with live FX conversion** — Store non-USD currencies in their native denomination (e.g., GBP as GBP, not as USD equivalent). Convert to primary currency using live FX rates in summary/TUI. Show FX rate and flag currency risk. This is a larger effort — may need to split into sub-tasks. Files: `src/models/position.rs`, `src/price/mod.rs` (FX rate fetching), `src/commands/summary.rs`, `src/tui/widgets/header.rs`.


## P2 — Chart Visual Enhancements



## P2 — Layout & Visual Polish

- [ ] **Add ultra-wide layout (160+ columns)** — When terminal is very wide, show a third column: market context panel with major indices and the portfolio sparkline below the positions table, with sidebar remaining as the chart panel. Three-column layout: 45% positions / 25% market context / 30% chart. Files: `src/tui/ui.rs` (new layout branch), new `src/tui/widgets/market_context.rs`. Test: test layout thresholds.

## P2 — Sidebar & Sparkline Enhancements



## P2 — Micro-Interactions & Feedback

- [ ] **Add loading skeleton for empty states** — When a view is loading data, show shimmer/skeleton placeholder rows instead of "Waiting for data...". Render 5-6 rows of `░░░░░░` block characters in `text_muted` with a wave animation (phase offset per row). Makes loading feel fast and intentional. Files: `src/tui/views/positions.rs`, `src/tui/views/markets.rs`, `src/tui/views/economy.rs`. Test: verify skeleton row count matches expected.

## P2 — Theme & Color Enhancements



## P2 — Data & Infrastructure

- [ ] **Add news feed integration** — Fetch financial news from a free RSS/API source (e.g., Yahoo Finance RSS, Finnhub free tier). Display as a scrollable list: timestamp, headline, source. Per-asset filtering. Files: new `src/news/` module, new `src/tui/views/news.rs`. Research: find best free news API that works without API key.
- [ ] **Add FRED economic data** — FRED API (free with API key) for treasury yields, CPI, unemployment, Fed funds rate. Store in new DB table. Cache aggressively (economic data updates daily at most). Files: new `src/data/fred.rs`, `src/db/economic_cache.rs`.
- [ ] **Add candlestick chart variant** — OHLC candlestick rendering using braille/block characters. Green body for close > open, red for close < open. Wicks as thin lines. Requires OHLC data in HistoryRecord. Files: `src/models/price.rs`, `src/price/yahoo.rs`, `src/tui/widgets/price_chart.rs`.


## P1 — Markets & Economy Tab Enhancements (Feedback)




## P2 — Scenario & Analytics (Feedback)

- [ ] **[Feedback] Add `--what-if` flag to summary** — `pftui summary --what-if GC=F:5500,BTC:55000` to model hypothetical price scenarios. Compute portfolio value and allocation under hypothetical prices. Transformative for scenario planning. Files: `src/commands/summary.rs` (parse what-if pairs, override cached prices for computation).
- [ ] **[Feedback] Add historical price snapshots** — `pftui history --date 2026-02-28` to show portfolio value and positions as of a past date using cached price history. Files: new `src/commands/history.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/db/price_history.rs`.

## P3 — Future

- [ ] **Portfolio analytics** — Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, volatility metrics, benchmark comparison
- [ ] **Dividend tracking** — Track dividend payments, show yield, ex-dates
- [ ] **Correlation matrix** — Visual correlation grid between portfolio positions
- [ ] **Multi-portfolio support** — Multiple named portfolios with switching
- [ ] **[Feedback] Price alerts** — Configurable threshold alerts with terminal notification. Feedback requests: `pftui alert GC=F above 5500` or `pftui alert GBPUSD below 1.30`. Both CLI and TUI integration. Bumped from P3 per tester request.
- [ ] **Custom keybinding config** — User-configurable keybindings in config.toml
- [ ] **Sector heatmap** — Treemap-style sector/industry performance view
- [ ] **Options chains** — Options display if a free data source exists


## P1 — Distribution & CI (Owner Priority)

> Name "pftui" is unclaimed on ALL major package managers. Prioritize crates.io and Homebrew first (covers 90% of terminal users), then expand.

- [ ] **Set up GitHub Actions CI** — Workflow for: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo build --release` on push/PR. Matrix: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest. Cache cargo registry + target dir. Files: new `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- [ ] **GitHub Releases with prebuilt binaries** — CI workflow that triggers on git tag (`v*`). Builds release binaries for linux-x86_64, linux-aarch64, macos-x86_64, macos-aarch64. Uploads as GitHub Release assets with checksums. Files: new `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [ ] **Homebrew formula** — Create a Homebrew tap (`homebrew-tap` repo) with a formula that downloads the GitHub Release binary for macOS. Auto-update formula on new releases via CI. `brew install skylarsimoncelli/tap/pftui`. Files: new repo `homebrew-tap`, formula `Formula/pftui.rb`, update release workflow to trigger formula bump.
- [ ] **Add install instructions to README** — Once releases and Homebrew are live, update README with: `brew install`, direct binary download, and `cargo install pftui` options. Files: `docs/README.md`.
- [ ] **Publish to crates.io** — `cargo publish` via CI on release tag. Enables `cargo install pftui` for Rust users. Add `description`, `license`, `repository`, `homepage`, `keywords`, `categories` to Cargo.toml. Files: `Cargo.toml`, release workflow.
- [ ] **AUR package** — Create an Arch Linux AUR package (`pftui-bin` for prebuilt, `pftui` for source build). PKGBUILD downloads from GitHub Releases. Files: new AUR repo, `PKGBUILD`.
- [ ] **Nix package** — Add a `flake.nix` for Nix/NixOS users. `nix run github:skylarsimoncelli/pftui`. Files: new `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`.
- [ ] **Scoop manifest (Windows)** — JSON manifest for Scoop package manager. Downloads Windows binary from GitHub Releases. Files: new `scoop/pftui.json` or submit to scoop extras bucket.
- [ ] **Snap / Flatpak** — Snap and/or Flatpak packaging for broader Linux distribution. Files: `snap/snapcraft.yaml` or `flatpak/com.github.skylarsimoncelli.pftui.yml`.
- [ ] **Docker image** — Minimal container image (`FROM scratch` or Alpine-based) for running pftui in Docker. `docker run -it pftui`. Files: `Dockerfile`, add to release workflow.
- [ ] **Debian/Ubuntu .deb package** — Build `.deb` via `cargo-deb` in release CI. Host a PPA or include `.deb` as GitHub Release asset. `apt install pftui`. Files: add `[package.metadata.deb]` to `Cargo.toml`, update release workflow.
- [ ] **RPM package (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)** — Build `.rpm` via `cargo-generate-rpm` in release CI. Host a COPR repo or include `.rpm` as GitHub Release asset. `dnf install pftui`. Files: add RPM metadata, update release workflow.

## P1 — Import/Export (Owner Request)



## P1 — Mock Mode (Owner Request)



## P2 — Web Interface (Owner Request)

- [ ] **Add `pftui web` subcommand** — Spins up a web server serving the portfolio UI in a browser. Subcommands:
  - `pftui web start [--bind <addr>] [--port <port>] [--password <pass>]` — Start server. Default: `127.0.0.1:8080`. Pass `--bind 0.0.0.0` for external access. Optional `--password` enables HTTP basic auth.
  - `pftui web stop` — Stop the running server (write PID file for management)
  - `pftui web status` — Show if running, bound address, port
  - The web UI should share as much logic as possible with the TUI — extract portfolio data computation, sorting, filtering, chart data generation into a shared `core` layer that both TUI and web consume. The web frontend renders the same data, NOT a copy of the TUI rendering code.
  - Tech stack suggestion: `axum` or `warp` for HTTP server, serve a lightweight JS frontend (or HTMX) that calls REST API endpoints backed by the shared core. Keep dependencies minimal.
  - Files: new `src/web/` module (server.rs, routes.rs, static/), refactor shared logic into `src/core/` if not already separated, `src/cli.rs`
  - This is a bigger effort — break into sub-tasks if needed:
    1. [ ] Extract shared core logic from TUI-specific rendering
    2. [ ] Build REST API (positions, transactions, watchlist, chart data, portfolio summary)
    3. [ ] Build minimal web frontend
    4. [ ] Add auth, bind options, PID management

## P2 — Remaining Package Managers (Need Owner Action)

- [ ] **Publish to Snapcraft** — snapcraft.yaml is in repo. Needs: 1) Create Snapcraft account at https://snapcraft.io 2) `snapcraft login` and export token 3) Add `SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN` as GitHub repo secret 4) Add snap publish step to release workflow. Files: `snap/snapcraft.yaml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [ ] **Publish to AUR** — Needs: 1) Create AUR account at https://aur.archlinux.org 2) Generate SSH key pair 3) Add `AUR_SSH_KEY` as GitHub repo secret 4) Create AUR package `pftui-bin` 5) Add AUR publish step to release workflow. Files: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [ ] **Publish to Scoop** — Needs Windows binary first. Add `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target to release workflow build matrix, then submit manifest to scoop-extras bucket or host own bucket. Files: `scoop/pftui.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- [ ] **Windows build support** — Add `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` to release build matrix (runs-on: windows-latest). Cross-platform terminal support via crossterm should work. Files: `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Test: verify TUI renders on Windows Terminal.

## Feedback Summary

**Last reviewed:** 2026-03-03

| Tester | Routine | Usefulness | Overall | Trend |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Sentinel Main | Interactive TUI Review | 75% | 78% | ↑↑ (+50/+38 from CLI review) |
| Sentinel Main | CLI Review (prior) | 25% | 40% | — (baseline) |
| Evening Eventuality Planner | Headless CLI | 20% | 38% | → (no new entry) |
| Portfolio Analyst | — | — | — | No data yet |

**Lowest scorer:** Evening Eventuality Planner (20% usefulness, 38% overall) — headless workflow. Their top requests (`pftui refresh`, `--period`, `--group-by`) are now ALL implemented but they haven't re-evaluated yet. Expect significant score improvement on next review.

**Highest scorer:** Sentinel Main TUI Review (75/78) — strong validation of TUI quality. Rated visual design, sparklines, ticker tape, and information hierarchy highly. Remaining gaps are analytical depth (correlation, benchmarks, risk metrics).

**Top 3 priorities based on feedback:**
1. ~~**`pftui refresh`**~~ ✅ DONE — ~~**`--period` flag**~~ ✅ DONE — ~~**`--group-by category`**~~ ✅ DONE — All three prior top priorities shipped.
2. **Native multi-currency with live FX conversion** (P1) — Shared pain point from both testers. GBP stored as USD equivalent masks currency risk. Base currency selection is done; full FX conversion is next.
3. **Enhanced Markets tab** (P1) — Sentinel TUI review requests mini-charts, heat maps, momentum indicators. Current tab is a simple price list. High-impact for the 78% → 85%+ push.

**Completed since last review:**
- ✅ `pftui refresh` (headless price command)
- ✅ `--period` flag (daily/weekly/monthly P&L)
- ✅ `--group-by category` (category allocation)
- ✅ Day P&L in header
- ✅ `pftui value` / `pftui brief` / `pftui watchlist` CLI commands
- ✅ `pftui set-cash` command
- ✅ CSV decimal rounding, `--notes` flag on list-tx
- ✅ Configurable base currency with symbol display

**Notes:**
- Sentinel's TUI score (78%) vs CLI score (40%) confirms: the TUI is strong, CLI/headless was the gap, and we've now closed most of it.
- Evening Eventuality Planner hasn't submitted a follow-up review — their 3 top requests are all shipped. Re-evaluation should show major improvement.
- Portfolio Analyst still has no data. Third tester activation remains a gap.
- Next score ceiling will be hit by analytical features: correlation, benchmarks, risk metrics, what-if scenarios. These are P2/P3 items that collectively represent the "70% → professional tool" gap Sentinel identified.

## P2 — Mouse Enhancements (Follow-up)

- [ ] **Click sort column headers** — Click on column headers (Asset, Qty, Price, Day%, Gain%, Alloc%, 52W, Trend) to sort by that column. Requires tracking rendered column header rects.
- [ ] **Click theme/privacy indicators** — Click on theme name in header to cycle theme, click on "[% view]" to toggle privacy mode.
- [ ] **Click allocation bars** — Click on a category bar in the portfolio overview to filter by that category.
- [ ] **Right-click context menu** — Context menu on position rows with: View Detail, Add Transaction, Delete, Copy Symbol.

## P2 — Theme Overhaul (Owner Request)

- [ ] **Continue theme overhaul** — 3 new themes added (Inferno, Neon, Hacker). Remaining work:
  - **Pastel** — soft, toned-down palette. Muted pinks, blues, greens on a warm gray. Easy on the eyes
  - **Miasma** — warm atmospheric haze. Deep burgundy, dusty orange, olive, muted gold
  - **Dracula** — make more vivid and punchy, lean into the purples
  - **Nord** — add more contrast, feels too washed out currently
  - **Solarized** — evaluate if it's distinct enough to keep, otherwise replace
  - **Gruvbox** — evaluate, replace with something more unique if too similar to Miasma
  - Test all 28 color slots per theme across all views to ensure nothing looks flat or broken
  - Files: `src/tui/theme.rs`, `src/tui/views/help.rs` (theme preview)
